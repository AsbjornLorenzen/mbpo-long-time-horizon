This is the MACURA_Submission folder containing the code to launch experiments for MUJOCO environments with the algorithms MBPO, M2AC and MACURA as described in the paper: Trust the Model Where It Trusts Itself - Model-Based Actor-Critic with Uncertainty-Aware Rollout Adaption.

When you want to reproduce the results you first need to install mujoco and many python packages. This process is described in InstallationGuide/InstallationGuide.txt.
The next step is to launch the experiments using the config manager hydra. A description how to launch the experiments of the paper is given in the folder "How_to_start_experiments".
